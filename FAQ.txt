# What is Céu?

Céu is a concurrent and reactive programming language that offers a safer 
and higher-level alternative to C.

# What is Céu based on?

Céu is based on Esterel.

# Where should I used Céu?

Any kind of reactive application, i.e., an application that interacts 
continuously with the environment.
The environment is an external actor that provides input to the application 
and expects output from it.
Examples: GUIs, games, network protocols.

# Is Céu yet another Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) variant?

No. Céu is quite imperative, actually.
It would be more accurate to call it a Imperative Reactive Programming (IRP) 
variant.

# How is Céu (IRP) different from FRP?

FRP is good to specify declarative/data dependency.
Céu is good to specify imperative/control dependency.

Blinking a LED is control-based: we have two states that we...

Two examples:

loop do
    await 1s;
    _led_toggle(1);
end

loop do
    var int dt = await DT;
    s = ;
end

# Are IRP and FRP equivalent?

Probably. They both rely on the synchronous concurrency models.
That being said, they xxx different programming styles
