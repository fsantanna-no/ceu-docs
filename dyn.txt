- Things to note

    - everything has lexical scope
        - variables
        - objects
            - dynamic instances
        - lines of execution
        * for programmers:
            - easy to ready/write code
                - compositions
        * for the compiler:
            - easy to analyze

        - implementation
            - all memory is statically allocated
                - no heap/GC
            - even dynamic instances
                - (optionally but recommended)
