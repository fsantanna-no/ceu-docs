 INTRODUCTION
=====================

Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are composed of a large number of tiny devices 
(known as "motes") capable of sensing the environment and communicating among 
them.
WSNs are usually employed to continuously monitor physical phenomena in large 
or unreachable areas, such as wildfire in forests and air temperature in 
buildings.
Each mote features limited processing capabilities, a short-range radio link, 
and one or more sensors (e.g. light and temperature). [1]

Software for WSNs is usually developed in the C programming language, and the 
addition of a real-time operating system may extend it with preemptive and/or 
cooperative multithreading. [2,3]
However, concurrency in C requires a low-level exercise related to scheduling, 
synchronizing, and the life cycle of activities (i.e. creating and destroying 
threads).

Concurrency in C also lacks safety warranties, given that they are susceptible 
to unbounded execution, race conditions and deadlocks.
However, safety is an important aspect in WSNs, as motes have scarce resources, 
are deployed in remote locations, and must run for long periods without human 
intervention.

Our research at PUC-Rio constitutes the development of Céu, a new programming 
language targeted at highly constrained embedded systems, which incorporates 
features found in dataflow and imperative reactive languages [4,5].
Céu supports concurrent lines of execution that run in time steps and are 
allowed to share variables.
However, the synchronous and static nature of Céu enables a compile time 
analysis that can enforce deterministic and memory-safe programs, offering a 
high-level and safe alternative to the predominating C based multithreaded 
systems.
The Céu compiler generates code comparable to handcrafted C programs in terms 
of size and portability.

Our research is part of a broader project called "Cidades Inteligentes" (Smart 
Cities), which involves 20 Brazilian Universities, an investment in the order 
of 1 million dollars, and aims to build an infrastructure of instrumentation, 
computation and communication for Wireless Sensor Networks.

 PROPOSAL
=====================

The Distributed Computing and Systems group in Chalmers has an open PhD 
Sandwich position in the area of "Secure Wireless Sensor Networks".
The research proposal includes programming languages technologies as one of its 
focus: "The Security group has developed the link between two areas of computer 
science: programming languages and computer security. The group explores 
security models and enforcement mechanisms based on programming-language 
technology".

We believe that WSNs are an ideal scenario to employ our research on Céu, given 
it is targeted at highly constrained embedded systems, offering fine-grained 
concurrency, low memory overhead, and safety warranties.

During the period of the sandwich doctorate, our goal is to evaluate the 
applicability of Céu in the context of WSNs and secure communications.
We intend to use the language in real-world applications under development in 
the research group.
It is part of the process to evolve the language together with the DCS group 
when identifying new requirements not currently addressed.

The DCS group in Chalmers also does research in many programming languages 
topics aligned with the programming model of Céu, which can also be explored 
during the PhD Sandwich.
The following list was extracted from the DCS website:

  * Investigate new techniques for achieving high parallelism and 
    fault-tolerance in distributed or parallel software.
  * Evaluate the performance of non-blocking synchronization in parallel 
    application and system software.
  * Non-blocking/fine-grain synchronization, aiming at increased parallelism, 
    fault-tolerance, avoiding convoy effects and priority inversion.
  * Enhancing performance by cooperative scheduling-and-synchronization.
	
We already have a working implementation of the language, which has been used 
in three different hands-on courses in WSNs.
Last year we presented a short paper in the doctoral colloquium of SenSys, a 
conference dedicated to WSNs. [6]
